## Decision

We decided to use TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language)
for configuring our Python applications. Here's why:

1. Easy to understand:

   - TOML has a straightforward syntax that is easy to read and understand.
   - It uses key-value pairs and hierarchies, making it intuitive for developers
   - to define configuration settings.

2. Clear and concise:

   - TOML allows us to define configuration options concisely and simply.
   - It lets us express complex data structures in a compact and readable format.

3. Ensures data integrity:

   - TOML supports different data types, like strings, numbers, booleans, and dates.
   - This ensures that configuration values are correctly interpreted by the application.

4. Standardized and widely supported:

   - TOML is a standardized configuration language with clear specifications.
   - It is supported by many programming languages, including Python.
   - Well-maintained libraries are available to read and parse TOML files in Python.

5. Works well with other tools:

   - TOML integrates seamlessly with other development tools.
   - It is commonly used with configuration management systems, build tools, and deployment frameworks.
   - This simplifies the exchange and sharing of configuration settings across different software components.

6. Version control-friendly:
   - TOML files are human-readable and easily managed with version control systems like Git.
   - This facilitates tracking changes to configuration settings and collaboration among team members.

## Risks and Mitigations

While using TOML for configuration offers benefits, there are some risks to consider:

1. Learning Curve:

   - Team members unfamiliar with TOML may need time to understand its syntax and usage.
   - We will provide documentation and support to help the team learn and adapt to TOML effectively.

2. Tooling Compatibility:
   - Some existing tools and systems may lack direct support for TOML.
   - We will evaluate and choose compatible tools or provide conversion capabilities if needed.

## Conclusion

By adopting TOML for configuring our Python applications, we benefit from its easy syntax, data validation, and compatibility with other tools. TOML provides a clear and concise way to define settings, improving clarity, reliability, and ease of managing configurations. Though there may be a learning curve and compatibility challenges, the advantages of using TOML outweigh the risks.
