## Insecure Data Storage (Metric Output Files)

### Threat

Insecure storage of metric output files, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access.

### Mitigation

Ensure that the metric output files are securely stored, utilizing appropriate file permissions and encryption. Implement
access controls and authentication mechanisms to restrict access to the metric output files to authorized users or processes.

## Insecure Logging Configuration

### Threat

Insecure logging configuration that may expose sensitive information or provide attackers with insights into the
application's internal workings.
