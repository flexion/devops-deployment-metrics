## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

Please label your bug report with the `bug` label.

## How to set up your development environment

If you're interested in contributing code, you can start by checking out this repository
[https://github.com/flexion/devops-deployment-metrics](https://github.com/flexion/devops-deployment-metrics).
Take a look through the issues and see if there are any tasks you are interested in working on.
Indicate you are working on a task by adding your GitHub @name after the task in the issue.
Definition of Done items are often a great starting point for contributing in a meaningful way while getting integrated into team practices.
Using SSH keys to check out the repository is ideal, as we require contributors to sign their commits.

You need Python 3.7+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
poetry run python
poetry run devops-deployment-metrics
```

[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

### Git pre-commit hooks

In order to ensure a consistent style for a number of different artifact types within this repository, all developers
should install, initialize, and run `pre-commit` in their development environment. Committing code and documentation
that does not pass the pre-commit checks is strongly discouraged. Instructions for doing so are below, with more details
at [https://pre-commit.com/#install](https://pre-commit.com/#install):

You can install pre-commit with pip:
`pip install pre-commit`

Or on a Mac you can use homebrew:
`brew install pre-commit`

After installation, set up the git hook scripts by running the following from the root of the repository:
`pre-commit install`

The pre-commit hooks will then run as a part of git commits, but you can also optionally run them against all files:
`pre-commit run --all-files`

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

## Contributors are required to sign commits

GitHub has made it simple for contributors to
[sign commits with their existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification).
1Password 8 has [some sugar](https://blog.1password.com/git-commit-signing/) that simplifies this.
Contributors should already be using SSH keys to push to GitHub.
